;;; Commentary:
;; 
;; EDE project Ibuffer integration functions.
;;
;; This file defines functions to allow `ibuffer' to filter
;; (`ibuffer-filter-by-ede-project'), mark
;; (`ibuffer-mark-by-ede-project-regexp'), and sort
;; (`ibuffer-do-sort-by-ede-project') the list of buffers based on
;; their EDE project root directory.
;; 
;; This file also defines a new column whose symbol 'ede-project can
;; be used in the value of `ibuffer-formats' to display the EDE
;; project directory of each buffer and summarize the total active EDE
;; projects.  See below for an example usage of the new column symbol
;; in `ibuffer-formats'.
;;
;; Finally, `ede-set-ibuffer-saved-filter-groups' can be used to
;; generate a filter group for each active EDE project in
;; `ede-projects' and save them to `ibuffer-saved-filter-groups'.  See
;; below for an example addition to `ibuffer-hook' which regenerates
;; and loads these filter groups automatically.
;;
;; Installation:
;;
;; Put ede-buffer.el somewhere in your load-path and add the following
;; in your init file:
;;
;; (require 'ede-ibuffer)
;; 
;; Below are example keybindings for the filter/mark/sort commands:
;; 
;; (define-key ibuffer-mode-map (kbd "/ e") 'ibuffer-filter-by-ede-project)
;; (define-key ibuffer-mode-map (kbd "% e") 'ibuffer-mark-by-ede-project-regexp)
;; (define-key ibuffer-mode-map (kbd "s e") 'ibuffer-do-sort-by-ede-project)
;; 
;; Below is an example value for `ibuffer-formats'.  When set, the
;; second format configuration replaces the filename-and-process
;; column with the new ede-project column (formats can be cycled with
;; `ibuffer-switch-format'):
;;
;; (setq ibuffer-formats
;;       '((mark modified read-only " "
;; 	      (name 18 18 :left :elide)
;; 	      " "
;; 	      (size 9 -1 :right)
;; 	      " "
;; 	      (mode 16 16 :left :elide)
;; 	      " " filename-and-process)
;; 	(mark modified read-only " "
;; 	      (name 18 18 :left :elide)
;; 	      " "
;; 	      (size 9 -1 :right)
;; 	      " "
;; 	      (mode 16 16 :left :elide)
;; 	      " " ede-project)
;; 	(mark " "
;; 	      (name 16 -1)
;; 	      " " filename)))
;;
;; Finally, below we use `ibuffer-hook' to call
;; `ede-set-ibuffer-saved-filter-groups' which regenerates the filter
;; groups for all active EDE projects and then runs
;; `ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups' in order to load the filter
;; groups each time we load or update Ibuffer:
;;
;; (add-hook 'ibuffer-hook
;;   (lambda ()
;;     (ede-set-ibuffer-saved-filter-groups)
;;     (ibuffer-switch-to-saved-filter-groups "ede-projects")))
